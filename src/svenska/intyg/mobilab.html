<h1>Rekommendation</h1>

<p> Rekommendation från Morris Packer, projektledare för arbetet
med Väderkanalen 2009:

<blockquote>

<p> John Ankarström was an integral part of the successful development
team that built TV4’s, Sweden's largest commercial TV-broadcaster,
mobile weather site http://m.vaderkanalen.se. Combining a clean and
neat design with geopositioning to provide the weather forecast of
where you are, right now.

<p> John’s contribution was vital, as one of two developers responsible
for designing and coding the css-structure for the site, recently
awarded “Best in test” for Swedish mobile weather sites by the
magazine “Mobil”.

<p> John & his team members performed professionally and delivered.
On time.

<p> Regardless of his age he functioned as a fully qualified team
member on equal terms - in fact we did not realize his age until
after the project was completed.

<p> I an not only willing to endorse John on Linkedin, I am proud
to do so. And I am looking forward to follow John’s future career.
