<p>This website used to be created with Jekyll, a static site generator
natively supported by GitHub Pages.  While this setup certainly is
capable, I came to realize that it didn’t fit my needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Jekyll gave me very little control over the final directory
structure of my site.  Whereas what I wanted was a one-to-one
correlation between the organization of my website and that of
my local file system, what I got was a one-size-fits-all blog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were discrepancies between my local installation of Jekyll
and that used by GitHub Pages – especially with regards to the
directory structure – which made it hard for me to foretell
what the finished site would look like after publishing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speaking of which – what <em>is</em> the benefit of having GitHub Pages
generate your site, compared with generating it locally (which
you’d almost always do anyway) and uploading the results?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These weren’t unmanageable problems, and I used Jekyll from September
till now.  However, my setup felt unwieldy and fragile, which brings
me to …</p>

<h2 id="section">2019</h2>

<p>Another year, another rewrite.  I started with a single Markdown
document and wrote a shell script, <code>bin/html-page</code>, to translate
it into a standalone HTML page:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# (1)
read
read datetime
read title
title=${title#\# }
read meta
read lang
text=$(bin/markdown)

# (2)
content=$(cat &lt;&lt;CONTENT
&lt;article&gt;
&lt;h1 id="title"&gt;$title&lt;/h1&gt;
${meta:+&lt;p id=\"meta\"&gt;&lt;time datetime=\"$datetime\"&gt;$meta&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}
&lt;div id="text"&gt;
$text
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
CONTENT)

# (3)
export lang author datetime title meta content
bin/html-page-tpl
</code></pre>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All Markdown documents begin with a block of metadata, as specified
in the beginning of this file.  The title can optionally begin with
a hash, as per Markdown syntax.  The text is retrieved from the
program specified in <code>bin/markdown</code>, receiving the rest of the text
via the standard input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then follows the template for a single HTML article, containing
every piece of information specified in the original Markdown file,
but lacking the scaffolding required by a full HTML document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, all variables are exported to be used by the template
specified in <code>bin/html-page-tpl</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Apropos, <code>bin/html-page-tpl</code> is a very simple file.  It uses <code>cat</code>
in combination with “here documents” to create a simple (but capable)
templating engine – no Liquid or ERB needed:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

cat &lt;&lt;TEMPLATE
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="$lang"&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;$title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name="author" content="$author" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="$base/style.css" /&gt;
$content
&lt;/html&gt;
TEMPLATE
</code></pre>

<p>To wrap it all up, a simple (GNU)makefile handles the file system
operations, taking Markdown files from <code>src/</code> and creating HTML
files in <code>dst/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>dst/%.html: src/%.md bin/html-page bin/html-page-tpl
	mkdir -p $$(dirname $@)
	cat $&lt; | bin/html-page &gt; $@
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>That’s the basic description of the system.  Of course, it is
incomplete – in addition to standalone pages, I offer an index page,
as well as an Atom feed – but all this other functionality is
implemented similarly to that which I have showed above.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in seeing the entire system, check out the
GitHub repository and the <code>bin/</code> directory in particular.</p>
