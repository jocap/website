<h1 id="title">Learning C as an uneducated hobbyist</h1>
<p id="meta"><time datetime="2019-01-21T21:26:31+01:00">(January, 2019)</time></p>
<div id="text">

<p>If you’re like me, you’ve never studied computer science, or anything
even related to technology.  You’ve never worked with computers,
you’ve barely, if ever, produced a single line of code professionally;
you’ve just always been <em>interested</em> – in your free time, as a hobby.</p>

<p>Maybe you started with HTML and CSS, building your own website,
picking up bits of JavaScript along the way, eventually learning
basic Unix shell commands for convenience.  Making your way through
the world of Unix-based web development, perhaps via Mac OS X or
GNU/Linux, you began to use scripting languages like PHP, Perl,
Ruby or Python.  You learned Git and started to explore Vim and
Emacs.</p>

<p>Today, if you’re anything like me, you feel pretty confident in the
skills you’ve built up: you can spin up a website in no time, you
know your way around a Unix-like operating system, you write clever
shell scripts to make your life easier.  You run GNU/Linux as your
main OS, or perhaps even a variant of BSD.</p>

<p>Yet there is one mountain that you haven’t ever been able to climb.
The big one.  The capital letter.  C.</p>

<hr />

<p>To people like me, C feels almost mythical: a language that offers
unparalleled power for the cost of unparalleled danger.  Of course,
C <em>isn’t</em> actually mythical; it’s been mytholog<em>ized</em> – and for people
who are forced to learn C anyway at university, this isn’t a problem,
but people without any formal education often never get the chance
to learn, that after all, C is just another programming language,
one that you don’t need any magic method or special knowledge to
learn.</p>

<p>Many who give advice on how to best learn C are people who’ve already
learned it and have long experience with it.  Almost without
exception, they tend to recommend reading <em>The C Programming Language</em>
by K&amp;R.</p>

<p>I, in constrast, am writing this as I’m just starting to get into
C for real, meaning I have begun to feel reasonably comfortable
with it and have started to use it as a go-to language for certain
tasks.  I haven’t read K&amp;R, and if you and I are the same type of
person, I wouldn’t recommend you do either.</p>

<p>At least not the whole thing right now.  Think about how you learned
the other languages you know.  What was the first thing you did?
To pick up a book?  No!  You tried to <em>use</em> it.  Now think about
at which point you felt that you were starting to actually learn
the language.  For me, it was always when I started using it to
write small, useful programs, often ones that I could’ve written
in another language, or perhaps ones that I already <em>had</em> written
in another language.</p>

<p>None of that changed for C.  I’m learning it exactly like I’ve
learned all other programming languages.  The only thing that has
changed is where I look for information.  Don’t worry, Stack Overflow
is still one of my most important resources, but I complement it
with my operating system’s man pages.</p>

<p>Whenever I find an answer to my question on the internet, I check
out the man page for every function that I need to call.  This makes
sure that I never miss anything important, like checking errors or
freeing allocated memory. Other times, I’m not confused about
specific functions, but about larger concepts.  In <em>these</em> cases,
I do find it useful to look up the topic in K&amp;R – it’s not a bad
book, it’s just that it’s hard to learn something by merely reading
and doing irrelevant exercises.</p>

<p>The point of this text is to emphasize that people learn differently,
especially if they have different levels of education.  While
university-educated programmers might learn best from a book,
self-taught programmers most likely don’t.  This is something to
keep in mind when giving advice to people who are learning a
programming language or, indeed, when learning one yourself.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-final-word-on-bad-practice">A final word on bad practice</h2>

<p>There is a difference between programming and driving.  Driving,
at its heart, is an unconscious activity – you don’t have to <em>think</em>
when you’re changing gears; you just do it, even while talking to
someone on the phone or listing to the radio – and once you really
learn a bad practice, like holding down the clutch pedal into an
intersection, it’s very hard to unlearn, because your driving isn’t
conscious.</p>

<p>Programming, however, <em>is</em> conscious.  It’s an activity in which
you have to <em>think</em> in order to act.  Unlearning bad practice in
programming takes no energy at all apart from that spent being told
that the practice is bad and coming to understand and remember it.
Once you’ve done that, it’s almost impossible to make the same
mistake again.</p>

<p>That’s why you shouldn’t be afraid of learning “along the way”, “as
you go” or “in an ad-hoc manner” because “you might learn bad
practice”.  If you learn the wrong thing, you can learn the right
thing later.  After all, you’re not a professional programmer.  It
doesn’t matter very much if you make a mistake; your job doesn’t
depend on it.</p>
