<h1 id="title">Using fzf on OpenBSD with mksh</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is a great tool for interactively finding and selecting files
and directories.  Unfortunately, however, it only supports bash and
fish, none of which I want to use on my OpenBSD system.  In this
post, I’d like to present what I believe to be a better solution.</p>

<p>Unlike many OpenBSD users, instead of the included <abbr title="Public Domain Korn Shell">(pd)ksh</abbr>, I use <a href="https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm">mksh</a>, which is an
implementation of Korn shell written by mirabilos for his MirBSD
operating system.  Compared with OpenBSD’s default ksh, mksh lacks
its clever support for custom completion<sup id="fnref:complete"><a href="#fn:complete" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but in exchange,
it offers some additional ways of interacting with the shell.</p>

<p>Most interestingly, it implements the <code>evaluate-region</code> editing
command, activated by <code>^[^E</code> (<em>meta + ctrl + e</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evaluates the text between the mark and the cursor
position (the entire line if no mark is set) as function
substitution (if it cannot be parsed, the editing state
is unchanged and the bell is rung to signal an error);
$? is updated accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that we can execute arbitary commands through a key
binding – exactly what we need for fzf!</p>

<p>In the end, this is what I’ve been able to piece together:</p>

<pre><code>export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='ag --nocolor -g "" 2&gt;/dev/null'
export FZF_DIR_COMMAND='find $PWD -type d 2&gt;/dev/null'
export FZF_IGNORE='-E "/\.cache\/|/\.git|/\.npm|/\.cpan"'

bind -m ^T='^[b^[f ^[ echo $(eval "$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND" | grep -v $FZF_IGNORE | fzf -m --reverse)^[^E'
bind -m ^[^T='^[b^[f ^[ echo $(eval "$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND" | grep -v $FZF_IGNORE | fzf -m --reverse | xargs -L1 readlink -f 2&gt;/dev/null)^[^E'
bind -m ^[c='^Ucd ^[ echo $(eval "$FZF_DIR_COMMAND" | grep -v $FZF_IGNORE | fzf --reverse)^[^E^J'
bind -m ^[^R=" ^Aecho \$(fc -nl 0 | trim | fzf +s --tac -q '^E')^[^E^J"
# ^ warning: beware of single quotes and mksh magic!
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><code>^T</code> appends your fzf selection to what you’ve already written</li>
  <li><code>^[^T</code> does the same, but follows symbolic links, appending the
path(s) of the target(s)</li>
  <li><code>^[c</code> discards what you’ve written and cd’s to a given directory</li>
  <li><code>^[^R</code> searches through your command history (based on what
you’ve already written)</li>
</ul>

<p>The good thing about this approach is that you get a very clean
command history, as none of the above key bindings press Return.
This is a clear benefit over (pd)ksh, in which the user cannot
execute commands without pressing Return (and thus adding to the
command history).</p>

<p>The drawback is that it’s a hacky approach.  Because of the way
it’s implemented, the last key binding breaks if your original input
contains single quotes.  Still, it works 90% of the time, and I
guess that’s good enough.</p>
